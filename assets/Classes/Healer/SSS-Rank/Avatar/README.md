# Avatar

**Role:** Force Embodiment / Temporary God Mode  
**Rank:** SSS-Rank  
**Base Class:** Healer

## Description

Avatars are healers who have become embodiments of fundamental forces of existence (Light, Shadow, Chaos, or Order). These transcendent beings can temporarily achieve god mode by channeling their chosen force. Avatars excel at short bursts of absolute power, but their true form requires long cooldowns to maintain balance. They represent the pinnacle of healing through divine embodiment, becoming forces of nature themselves.
