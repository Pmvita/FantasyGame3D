# Void Warlock

**Role:** Reality Bending Mage / Corruption Specialist  
**Rank:** SS-Rank  
**Base Class:** Mage (Warlock/Dark Mage path)

## Description

Void Warlocks are mages who have fully embraced the corruption of the void, wielding reality-bending magic at a great personal cost. These dangerous casters excel at manipulating the fabric of reality itself, but each use of their power corrupts them further. Void Warlocks scale incredibly with corruption, becoming more powerful as they risk more, but the corruption can consume them if not managed carefully. Power at a cost, dangerous scaling.

## Skills

### 1. Void Corruption
**Type:** Self-Buff / Risk System  
**Mana Cost:** 0 (Uses Corruption)  
**Cooldown:** None  
**Description:** Embrace void corruption, gaining 5% increased damage per corruption stack. Maximum 20 stacks (100% damage increase). Each stack increases your power but also your vulnerability. Corruption decays slowly or can be consumed for powerful abilities. Dangerous scaling mechanic.

### 2. Reality Tear
**Type:** Area Damage / Corruption  
**Mana Cost:** 80  
**Cooldown:** 45 seconds  
**Description:** Tear a hole in reality itself, dealing massive void damage to all enemies in a large area. The tear persists for 20 seconds, continuing to damage enemies. Using this ability increases corruption by 2 stacks. The more corruption, the larger and more damaging the tear becomes.

### 3. Corrupted Blast
**Type:** Damage / Corruption Scaling  
**Mana Cost:** 50  
**Cooldown:** 10 seconds  
**Description:** Unleash a blast of corrupted void energy that deals base damage plus damage equal to your current corruption stacks multiplied by 50%. At 20 corruption stacks, deals 1000% base damage. Powerful but risky at high corruption.

### 4. Void Shield
**Type:** Defensive / Corruption Conversion  
**Mana Cost:** 60  
**Cooldown:** 90 seconds  
**Description:** Convert corruption stacks into a shield that absorbs damage. Each corruption stack converted provides 5% maximum health as shield. The shield lasts 30 seconds or until broken. Consumes corruption to survive, trading power for safety.

### 5. Absolute Corruption
**Type:** Ultimate Transformation / High Risk  
**Mana Cost:** 150 (Requires 15+ corruption stacks)  
**Cooldown:** 600 seconds (10 minutes)  
**Description:** Fully embrace the void's corruption, becoming a being of pure void energy for 60 seconds. While transformed, corruption cannot be reduced, all abilities cost no mana, and damage is increased by 200% + (corruption stacks × 10%). However, if you die while corrupted, you cannot be resurrected for 5 minutes. Ultimate power at ultimate cost.
